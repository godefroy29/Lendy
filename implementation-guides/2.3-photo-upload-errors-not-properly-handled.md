# 2.3 Photo Upload Errors Not Properly Handled

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** Bug Fixes  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Difficulty:** 4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Modification Location:** Flutter Code

## Description

In `StorageRepository.uploadPhotos()`, errors are silently ignored, which may lead to incomplete uploads without user notification.

## Implementation Details

- Collect errors during photo upload
- Return both successful URLs and error information
- Show user which photos failed to upload
- Allow retry for failed uploads
- Update `CreateItemScreen` to handle partial upload failures
- Consider showing progress indicator for multiple photo uploads

## Files to Modify

- **Modify:** `lendy/lib/data/repositories/storage_repository.dart` (uploadPhotos method)
- **Modify:** `lendy/lib/presentation/screens/create_item_screen.dart` (handle upload errors)

## Dependencies

None

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `PhotoUploadResult` class with `successfulUrls` and `errors` list
2. Modify `uploadPhotos()` to collect errors and return `PhotoUploadResult`
3. Update `CreateItemScreen` to check for errors in upload result
4. Show user-friendly error messages for failed uploads
5. Allow partial success (some photos uploaded, some failed)
6. Optionally add retry functionality for failed uploads
